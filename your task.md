# AI Agent Prompt: COVID-19 Data Analysis Project (R Programming)

## Project Context
You are tasked with exploiting a COVID-19 dataset (CSV format) to clean, transform, and extract relevant descriptive analysis. This project aims to demonstrate technical and analytical skills in data science using R programming.

## Project Objectives

Your mission is to:

### 1. Data Import & Exploration
- Import and explore the real COVID-19 dataset in R you will find the dataset under the same folder in /data/raw/owid-covid-data.csv
- Examine the structure, dimensions, and initial characteristics of the data
-note : the data is to big just have a good look at it to figuer out what to do

### 2. Data Manipulation
- Manipulate, filter, and recode variables (numeric, categorical, and boolean)
- Handle missing values and data quality issues
- Transform variables as needed for analysis

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Generate new derived variables based on calculations or conditions
- Create meaningful indicators from existing data columns

### 4. Programming Techniques
- Use conditional structures (if/else statements) to implement data treatments
- Implement loops to automate repetitive processing tasks
- Develop custom functions and apply them to data subsets

### 5. Data Visualization
- Create relevant visualizations using ggplot2 to support the analysis
- Ensure graphs are clear, informative, and properly labeled

## Dataset Information
**Dataset**: COVID-19 data (under the same workspace folder in "/data/raw/owid-covid-data.csv")

**Important**: Before proceeding with the analysis, carefully read the column definitions in the dataset to understand:
- What each variable represents
- The data types and formats
- The relationships between variables
- What analyses would be most appropriate

## Deliverables Required

### 1. R Script (Projet_R_YousseKhabir.R)
- Well-commented code
- Clear section organization
- Reproducible analysis workflow

### 2. Descriptive Report (md format) including:

#### a) Introduction
- Project objective
- Dataset presentation (source, size, variables)
- Research questions or analysis goals

#### b) Data Preparation Process
- Data cleaning steps
- Variable transformations
- Feature engineering decisions
- Handling of missing or anomalous values

#### c) Statistical and Graphical Analyses
- Descriptive statistics
- Distribution analyses
- Relationships between variables
- Visualizations with ggplot2
- Key findings from the data

#### d) Conclusion
- Interpretation of results
- Key insights discovered
- Limitations and potential improvements
- Recommendations based on findings

## Technical Requirements
- Use R programming language
- Leverage tidyverse packages (dplyr, ggplot2, etc.)
- Implement proper coding practices (commenting, function documentation)
- Ensure reproducibility of all analyses

## Evaluation Criteria
Your work will be assessed on:
- Data manipulation skills
- Quality of statistical analysis
- Relevance and clarity of visualizations
- Code quality and organization
- Depth of interpretation
- Professional presentation of the report

**Note**: Ensure you thoroughly understand the COVID-19 dataset column definitions before beginning your analysis, as this will guide your analytical decisions and ensure meaningful insights.
